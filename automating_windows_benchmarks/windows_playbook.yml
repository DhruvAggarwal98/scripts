      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)'
      Description: This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.  The recommended state for this setting is: `24 or more password(s)`.
      Rationale: The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.  If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password.

      Control-ID: 1.1.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '60 or fewer days, but not 0'
      Description: This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.  Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.  Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.  The recommended state for this setting is `60 or fewer days, but not 0`.
      Rationale: The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access.

      Control-ID: 1.1.3
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)'
      Description: This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days.  The recommended state for this setting is: `1 or more day(s)`.
      Rationale: Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'
      Description: This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.  The recommended state for this setting is: `14 or more character(s)`.  **Note:** In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.
      Rationale: Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.

      Control-ID: 1.1.5
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.  When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: - Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters  - Be at least six characters in length  - Contain characters from three of the following categories: - English uppercase characters (A through Z) - English lowercase characters (a through z) - Base 10 digits (0 through 9) - Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.  Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools.

      Control-ID: 1.1.6
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system security.

      Control-ID: 1.2.1
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more minute(s)'
      Description: This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them.  Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `15 or more minute(s)`.
      Rationale: A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.

      Control-ID: 1.2.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '10 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0'
      Description: This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is locked. Setting this policy to `0` does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables the account lockout threshold.  The recommended state for this setting is: `10 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0`.
      Rationale: Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low introduces risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out accounts.

      Control-ID: 1.2.3
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or more minute(s)'
      Description: This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.  If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.  The recommended state for this setting is: `15 or more minute(s)`.
      Rationale: Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller' is set to 'No One'
      Description: This security setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup and Restore. No accounts should have this user right, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users' saved credentials might be compromised if this user right is assigned to other entities.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.
      Rationale: If an account is given this right the user of the account may create an application that calls into Credential Manager and is returned the credentials for another user.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Access this computer from the network' is set to 'Administrators, Authenticated Users, ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model Plus (COM+).  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, Authenticated Users, ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS`.
      Rationale: Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target computers for which they have permission. For example, the **Access this computer from the network** user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the `Everyone` group, then anyone will be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the `Everyone` group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Act as part of the operating system' is set to 'No One'
      Description: This policy setting allows a process to assume the identity of any user and thus gain access to the resources that the user is authorized to access.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: The **Act as part of the operating system** user right is extremely powerful. Anyone with this user right can take complete control of the computer and erase evidence of their activities.

      Control-ID: 2.2.5
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Add workstations to domain' is set to 'Administrators' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to the domain. For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the **Default Domain Controller Policy** for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the _Create Computer Objects_ permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether or not they have been assigned the **Add workstations to domain** user right.  In Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: The **Add workstations to domain** user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install Windows on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the password for the local Administrator account, and could log on with that account and then add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.

      Control-ID: 2.2.6
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Adjust memory quotas for a process' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE'
      Description: This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum amount of memory that is available to a process. The ability to adjust memory quotas is useful for system tuning, but it can be abused. In the wrong hands, it could be used to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE`.  **Note:** A Member Server that holds the _Web Server (IIS)_ Role with _Web Server_ Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to be granted this user right.  **Note #2:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: A user with the **Adjust memory quotas for a process** user right can reduce the amount of memory that is available to any process, which could cause business-critical network applications to become slow or to fail. In the wrong hands, this privilege could be used to start a denial of service (DoS) attack.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on locally' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right should generally be restricted to the `Administrators` group. Assign this user right to the `Backup Operators` group if your organization requires that they have this capability.
      Rationale: Any account with the **Allow log on locally** user right can log on at the console of the computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run malicious software to elevate their privileges.

      Control-ID: 2.2.8
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services' is set to 'Administrators' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Remote Desktop Services client. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only to the `Administrators` group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the `Remote Desktop Users` group.  Restrict this user right to the `Administrators` group, and possibly the `Remote Desktop Users` group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your network by means of the Remote Assistance feature.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** A Member Server that holds the _Remote Desktop Services_ Role with _Remote Desktop Connection Broker_ Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the `Authenticated Users` group to be granted this user right.  **Note #2:** The above lists are to be treated as whitelists, which implies that the above principals need not be present for assessment of this recommendation to pass.  **Note #3:** In all versions of Windows Server prior to Server 2008 R2, **Remote Desktop Services** was known as **Terminal Services**, so you should substitute the older term if comparing against an older OS.
      Rationale: Any account with the **Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services** user right can log on to the remote console of the computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run malicious software to elevate their privileges.

      Control-ID: 2.2.10
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Back up files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as `NTBACKUP`) attempts to access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a non-domain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the data. They could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is contained within the backup set.

      Control-ID: 2.2.11
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Change the system time' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE`.  **Note:** Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.
      Rationale: Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.  The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:  - All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner. - All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. - All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. - The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.  This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.

      Description: This setting determines which users can change the time zone of the computer. This ability holds no great danger for the computer and may be useful for mobile workers.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE`.
      Rationale: Changing the time zone represents little vulnerability because the system time is not affected. This setting merely enables users to display their preferred time zone while being synchronized with Domain Controllers in different time zones.

      Description: This policy setting allows users to change the size of the pagefile. By making the pagefile extremely large or extremely small, an attacker could easily affect the performance of a compromised computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: Users who can change the page file size could make it extremely small or move the file to a highly fragmented storage volume, which could cause reduced computer performance.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Create a token object' is set to 'No One'
      Description: This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated rights to access sensitive data.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign any user accounts this right.  The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the level of access for any currently logged on account. They could escalate their own privileges or create a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Create global objects' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right.  Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users' sessions. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as application failure or data corruption.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE`.  **Note:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server _and_ its optional "Integration Services" component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: Users who can create global objects could affect Windows services and processes that run under other user or system accounts. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as application failure, data corruption and elevation of privilege.

      Description: This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. However, components that run in kernel mode have this user right inherently. Therefore, it is typically not necessary to specifically assign this user right.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.
      Rationale: Users who have the **Create permanent shared objects** user right could create new shared objects and expose sensitive data to the network.

      Control-ID: 2.2.17
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Create symbolic links' is set to 'Administrators' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.  Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only `Administrators` can create symbolic links.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: Users who have the **Create symbolic links** user right could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Debug programs' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new system components will need it.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: The **Debug programs** user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the **Debug programs** user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network' to include 'Guests' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer. Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. This user right supersedes the **Access this computer from the network** user right if an account is subject to both policies.  The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests`.  **Caution:** Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the server.  **Note:** The security identifier `Local account and member of Administrators group` is not available in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) unless [MSKB 2871997](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871997) has been installed.  **Note #2:** Configuring a Member Server or standalone server as described above may adversely affect applications that create a local service account and place it in the Administrators group - in which case you must either convert the application to use a domain-hosted service account, or remove `Local account and member of Administrators group` from this User Right Assignment. Using a domain-hosted service account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.
      Rationale: Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a batch job' to include 'Guests'
      Description: This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer as a batch job. A batch job is not a batch (.bat) file, but rather a batch-queue facility. Accounts that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right.  This user right supersedes the **Log on as a batch job** user right, which could be used to allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the recommended accounts can be a security risk.  The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests`.
      Rationale: Accounts that have the **Log on as a batch job** user right could be used to schedule jobs that could consume excessive computer resources and cause a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a service' to include 'Guests'
      Description: This security setting determines which service accounts are prevented from registering a process as a service. This user right supersedes the **Log on as a service** user right if an account is subject to both policies.  The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests`.  **Note:** This security setting does not apply to the `System`, `Local Service`, or `Network Service` accounts.
      Rationale: Accounts that can log on as a service could be used to configure and start new unauthorized services, such as a keylogger or other malicious software. The benefit of the specified countermeasure is somewhat reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services, and an attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the `System` account.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on locally' to include 'Guests'
      Description: This security setting determines which users are prevented from logging on at the computer. This policy setting supersedes the **Allow log on locally** policy setting if an account is subject to both policies.  The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests`.  **Important:** If you apply this security policy to the `Everyone` group, no one will be able to log on locally.
      Rationale: Any account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services' to include 'Guests' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients. After the baseline Member Server is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use local accounts to access the server from the network. Domain accounts can access the server for administration and end-user processing. This user right supersedes the **Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services** user right if an account is subject to both policies.  The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Guests`.  **Caution:** Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the server.  **Note:** The security identifier `Local account` is not available in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) unless [MSKB 2871997](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871997) has been installed.  **Note #2:** In all versions of Windows Server prior to Server 2008 R2, **Remote Desktop Services** was known as **Terminal Services**, so you should substitute the older term if comparing against an older OS.
      Rationale: Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to log on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation' is set to 'Administrators' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting allows users to change the Trusted for Delegation setting on a computer object in Active Directory. Abuse of this privilege could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: Misuse of the **Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation** user right could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network. An attacker could exploit this privilege to gain access to network resources and make it difficult to determine what has happened after a security incident.

      Description: This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based and newer computers from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators be assigned this user right.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: Any user who can shut down a computer could cause a DoS condition to occur. Therefore, this user right should be tightly restricted.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Generate security audits' is set to 'LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users or processes can generate audit records in the Security log.  The recommended state for this setting is: `LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  **Note #2:** A Member Server that holds the _Web Server (IIS)_ Role with _Web Server_ Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to be granted this user right.  **Note #3:** A Member Server that holds the _Active Directory Federation Services_ Role will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the `NT SERVICE\ADFSSrv` and `NT SERVICE\DRS` services, as well as the associated Active Directory Federation Services service account, to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activity. Also, if the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Impersonate a client after authentication' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE' (DC only)
      Description: The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.  Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started.  Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist: - The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. - The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token. - The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.  An attacker with the **Impersonate a client after authentication** user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  **Note #2:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server _and_ its optional "Integration Services" component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: An attacker with the **Impersonate a client after authentication** user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether users can increase the base priority class of a process. (It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority class.) This user right is not required by administrative tools that are supplied with the operating system but might be required by software development tools.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: A user who is assigned this user right could increase the scheduling priority of a process to Real-Time, which would leave little processing time for all other processes and could lead to a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Load and unload device drivers' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting allows users to dynamically load a new device driver on a system. An attacker could potentially use this capability to install malicious code that appears to be a device driver. This user right is required for users to add local printers or printer drivers in Windows Vista.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: Device drivers run as highly privileged code. A user who has the **Load and unload device drivers** user right could unintentionally install malicious code that masquerades as a device driver. Administrators should exercise greater care and install only drivers with verified digital signatures.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Lock pages in memory' is set to 'No One'
      Description: This policy setting allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. If this user right is assigned, significant degradation of system performance can occur.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.  **Note:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: Users with the **Lock pages in memory** user right could assign physical memory to several processes, which could leave little or no RAM for other processes and result in a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Manage auditing and security log' is set to 'Administrators' and (when Exchange is running in the environment) 'Exchange Servers' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines which users can change the auditing options for files and directories and clear the Security log.  For environments running Microsoft Exchange Server, the `Exchange Servers` group must possess this privilege on Domain Controllers to properly function. Given this, DCs that grant the `Exchange Servers` group this privilege also conform to this benchmark. If the environment does not use Microsoft Exchange Server, then this privilege should be limited to only `Administrators` on DCs.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators` and (when Exchange is running in the environment) `Exchange Servers`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: The ability to manage the Security event log is a powerful user right and it should be closely guarded. Anyone with this user right can clear the Security log to erase important evidence of unauthorized activity.

      Description: This privilege determines which user accounts can modify the integrity label of objects, such as files, registry keys, or processes owned by other users. Processes running under a user account can modify the label of an object owned by that user to a lower level without this privilege.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.
      Rationale: By modifying the integrity label of an object owned by another user a malicious user may cause them to execute code at a higher level of privilege than intended.

      Description: This policy setting allows users to configure the system-wide environment variables that affect hardware configuration. This information is typically stored in the Last Known Good Configuration. Modification of these values and could lead to a hardware failure that would result in a denial of service condition.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: Anyone who is assigned the **Modify firmware environment values** user right could configure the settings of a hardware component to cause it to fail, which could lead to data corruption or a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Profile single process' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need this user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the **Profile single process** user right prevents intruders from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an attack on the system.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: The **Profile single process** user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to determine what processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as antivirus software, an intrusion-detection system, or which other users are logged on to a computer.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Profile system performance' is set to 'Administrators, NT SERVICE\WdiServiceHost'
      Description: This policy setting allows users to use tools to view the performance of different system processes, which could be abused to allow attackers to determine a system's active processes and provide insight into the potential attack surface of the computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators, NT SERVICE\WdiServiceHost`.
      Rationale: The **Profile system performance** user right poses a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might wish to attack directly. Attackers may also be able to determine what processes are active on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as antivirus software or an intrusion detection system.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Replace a process level token' is set to 'LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE'
      Description: This policy setting allows one process or service to start another service or process with a different security access token, which can be used to modify the security access token of that sub-process and result in the escalation of privileges.  The recommended state for this setting is: `LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  **Note #2:** A Member Server that holds the _Web Server (IIS)_ Role with _Web Server_ Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to be granted this user right.  **Note #3:** A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
      Rationale: Users with the **Replace a process level token** privilege are able to start processes as other users whose credentials they know. They could use this method to hide their unauthorized actions on the computer. (On Windows 2000-based computers, use of the **Replace a process level token** user right also requires the user to have the **Adjust memory quotas for a process** user right that is discussed earlier in this section.)

      Control-ID: 2.2.45
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the **Back up files and directories** user right.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: An attacker with the **Restore files and directories** user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer.  **Note:** Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Shut down the system' is set to 'Administrators'
      Description: This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers in your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command. Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: The ability to shut down Domain Controllers and Member Servers should be limited to a very small number of trusted Administrators. Although the **Shut down the system** user right requires the ability to log on to the server, you should be very careful about which accounts and groups you allow to shut down a Domain Controller or Member Server.  When a Domain Controller is shut down, it is no longer available to process logons, serve Group Policy, and answer Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries. If you shut down Domain Controllers that possess Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) roles, you can disable key domain functionality, such as processing logons for new passwords — one of the functions of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator role.

      Description: This security setting determines which users and groups have the authority to synchronize all directory service data. This is also known as Active Directory synchronization.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No One`.
      Rationale: The **Synchronize directory service data** user right affects Domain Controllers; only Domain Controllers should be able to synchronize directory service data. Domain Controllers have this user right inherently, because the synchronization process runs in the context of the `System` account on Domain Controllers. Attackers who have this user right can view all information stored within the directory. They could then use some of that information to facilitate additional attacks or expose sensitive data, such as direct telephone numbers or physical addresses.

      Description: This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys, processes, or threads. This user right bypasses any permissions that are in place to protect objects to give ownership to the specified user.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.  **Note:** This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
      Rationale: Any users with the **Take ownership of files or other objects** user right can take control of any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any changes they wish to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data, corruption of data, or a DoS condition.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts' is set to 'Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts'
      Description: This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts`.
      Rationale: Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems.

      Control-ID: 2.3.1.4
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the keyboard of the computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.

      Control-ID: 2.3.1.5
      Title: (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account'
      Description: The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.
      Rationale: The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.  The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.

      Title: (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename guest account'
      Description: The built-in local guest account is another well-known name to attackers. It is recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose. Even if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for added security. On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Guest account that was established when the domain was first created.
      Rationale: The Guest account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista.  The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Important:** Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance.
      Rationale: Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

      Control-ID: 2.3.2.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.  If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely force a computer shutdown.

      Description: This policy setting determines who is allowed to format and eject removable NTFS media. You can use this policy setting to prevent unauthorized users from removing data on one computer to access it on another computer on which they have local administrator privileges.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Administrators`.
      Rationale: Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they have administrative privileges. The user could then take ownership of any file, grant themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that most removable storage devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this policy setting.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators.
      Rationale: It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: Allow server operators to schedule tasks' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines whether members of the Server Operators group are allowed to submit jobs by means of the AT schedule facility. The impact of this policy setting configuration should be small for most organizations. Users, including those in the Server Operators group, will still be able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler Wizard, but those jobs will run in the context of the account with which the user authenticates when they set up the job.  **Note:** An AT Service Account can be modified to select a different account rather than the LOCAL SYSTEM account. To change the account, open System Tools, click Scheduled Tasks, and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on the Advanced menu.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: If you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of the AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service. By default, that is the local SYSTEM account. If you enable this policy setting, server operators could perform tasks that SYSTEM is able to do but that they would typically not be able to do, such as add their account to the local Administrators group.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements' is set to 'Require signing' (DC only)
      Description: This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Require signing`.  **Note:** Domain member computers must have _Network security: LDAP signing requirements_ (Rule 2.3.11.8) set to `Negotiate signing` or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate once the above `Require signing` value is configured on the Domain Controllers. Fortunately, `Negotiate signing` is the default in the client configuration.  **Note #2:** This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (`ldap_simple_bind`) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (`ldap_simple_bind_s`). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller.  **Note #3:** Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients (including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: [Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC’s – Practical Windows Security](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/russellt/2016/01/13/identifying-clear-text-ldap-binds-to-your-dcs/)
      Rationale: Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.  Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network.

      Control-ID: 2.3.5.3
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: Refuse machine account password changes' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only)
      Description: This security setting determines whether Domain Controllers will refuse requests from member computers to change computer account passwords.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration, particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.
      Rationale: If you enable this policy setting on all Domain Controllers in a domain, domain members will not be able to change their computer account passwords, and those passwords will be more susceptible to attack.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always)' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as passwords are encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted.  Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the Domain Controller.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate encryption for all secure channel traffic that it initiates.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as passwords are encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted.  Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the Domain Controller.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate whether all secure channel traffic that it initiates must be digitally signed. Digital signatures protect the traffic from being modified by anyone who captures the data as it traverses the network.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as passwords are encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Disable machine account password changes' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the password for the system's domain account.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration, particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.
      Rationale: The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003 will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Maximum machine account password age' is set to '30 or fewer days, but not 0'
      Description: This policy setting determines the maximum allowable age for a computer account password. By default, domain members automatically change their domain passwords every 30 days.  The recommended state for this setting is: `30 or fewer days, but not 0`.  **Note:** A value of `0` does not conform to the benchmark as it disables maximum password age.  **Note #2:** Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration, particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.
      Rationale: In Active Directory-based domains, each computer has an account and password just like every user. By default, the domain members automatically change their domain password every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that the computers no longer change their passwords, an attacker will have more time to undertake a brute force attack to guess the passwords of computer accounts.

      Control-ID: 2.3.6.6
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit) session key.  To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of hacking in which network data is read or altered in transit. The data can be modified to hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Do not display last user name' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether the account name of the last user to log on to the client computers in your organization will be displayed in each computer's respective Windows logon screen. Enable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your organization.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of a trusted path.  An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

      Description: Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time exceeds the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.  The recommended state for this setting is: `900 or fewer second(s), but not 0`.  **Note:** A value of `0` does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine inactivity limit.

      Description: This policy setting specifies a text message that displays to users when they log on. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.
      Rationale: Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help to reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the logon process. This text is often used for legal reasons—for example, to warn users about the ramifications of misusing company information or to warn them that their actions may be audited.  **Note:** Any warning that you display should first be approved by your organization's legal and human resources representatives.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Prompt user to change password before expiration' is set to 'between 5 and 14 days'
      Description: This policy setting determines how far in advance users are warned that their password will expire. It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to at least 5 days but no more than 14 days to sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire.  The recommended state for this setting is: `between 5 and 14 days`.
      Rationale: It is recommended that user passwords be configured to expire periodically. Users will need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN) connections.

      Description: This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Lock Workstation`. Configuring this setting to `Force Logoff` or `Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session` also conforms to the benchmark.
      Rationale: Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.  **Note:** When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting, **Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)**, on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.  SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether the SMB redirector will send plaintext passwords during authentication to third-party SMB servers that do not support password encryption.  It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business case to enable it. If this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed across the network.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across the network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security risk. These other computers may not use any of the SMB security mechanisms that are included with Windows Server 2003.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Amount of idle time required before suspending session' is set to '15 or fewer minute(s)'
      Description: This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished.  The maximum value is 99999, which is over 69 days; in effect, this value disables the setting.  The recommended state for this setting is: `15 or fewer minute(s)`.
      Rationale: Each SMB session consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow the server or possibly cause it to fail. An attacker could repeatedly establish SMB sessions until the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.

      Description: This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the Server Message Block (SMB) component. If you enable this policy setting you should also enable _Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire_ (Rule 2.3.11.6).  If your organization configures logon hours for users, this policy setting is necessary to ensure they are effective.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: If your organization configures logon hours for users, then it makes sense to enable this policy setting. Otherwise, users who should not have access to network resources outside of their logon hours may actually be able to continue to use those resources with sessions that were established during allowed hours.

      Rationale: If this policy setting is enabled, a user with local access could use the well-known Administrator's SID to learn the real name of the built-in Administrator account, even if it has been renamed. That person could then use the account name to initiate a password guessing attack.

There was a setting with that name in Windows XP, but it is called "Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and sub-paths" in Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 (non-R2).  **Note #2:** When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again, etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed delimited list in a REG\_MULTI\_SZ value.

      Rationale: The registry is a database that contains computer configuration information, and much of the information is sensitive. An attacker could use this information to facilitate unauthorized activities. To reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned throughout the registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.

      Title: (L1) Configure 'Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and sub-paths'
      Description: This policy setting determines which registry paths and sub-paths will be accessible over the network, regardless of the users or groups listed in the access control list (ACL) of the `winreg` registry key.  **Note:** In Windows XP this setting is called "Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths," the setting with that same name in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), and Windows Server 2003 does not exist in Windows XP.  **Note #2:** When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again, etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed delimited list in a REG\_MULTI\_SZ value.  The recommended state for this setting is:   ``` System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog Software\Microsoft\OLAP Server Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\UserConfig System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\DefaultUserConfiguration Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonLog ``` The recommended state for servers that hold the _Active Directory Certificate Services_ Role with _Certification Authority_ Role Service includes the above list and:   ``` System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CertSvc ``` The recommended state for servers that have the _WINS Server_ Feature installed includes the above list and:   ``` System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS ```
      Rationale: The registry contains sensitive computer configuration information that could be used by an attacker to facilitate unauthorized activities. The fact that the default ACLs assigned throughout the registry are fairly restrictive and help to protect the registry from access by unauthorized users reduces the risk of such an attack.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: When enabled, this policy setting restricts anonymous access to only those shares and pipes that are named in the `Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously` and `Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously` settings. This policy setting controls null session access to shares on your computers by adding `RestrictNullSessAccess` with the value `1` in the  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters`  registry key. This registry value toggles null session shares on or off to control whether the server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Null sessions are a weakness that can be exploited through shares (including the default shares) on computers in your environment.

      Description: This policy setting determines which network shares can be accessed by anonymous users. The default configuration for this policy setting has little effect because all users have to be authenticated before they can access shared resources on the server.  The recommended state for this setting is: `<blank>` (i.e. None).
      Rationale: It is very dangerous to allow any values in this setting. Any shares that are listed can be accessed by any network user, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts' is set to 'Classic - local users authenticate as themselves'
      Description: This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Classic - local users authenticate as themselves`.  **Note:** This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).
      Rationale: With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system resources.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Allow Local System to use computer identity for NTLM' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When connecting with a NULL session, a system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors. When connecting with the computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data protection.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.  The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.  With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, `Spnego.dll`. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, `Negoexts.dll`, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.  When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, `Negoexts.dll` calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be managed centrally in most managed networks.

      Rationale: The strength of each encryption algorithm varies from one to the next, choosing stronger algorithms will reduce the risk of compromise however doing so may cause issues when the computer attempts to authenticate with systems that do not support them.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash. Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.  **Note:** Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for these types of attacks to succeed.

This setting affects the Server Message Block (SMB) component. If you enable this policy setting you should also enable _Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients when logon hours expire_ (Rule 2.3.9.4).  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'
      Description: LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:  - Join a domain - Authenticate between Active Directory forests - Authenticate to down-level domains - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain  The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM`.
      Rationale: Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.  The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LDAP client signing requirements' is set to 'Negotiate signing' or higher
      Description: This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients that issue LDAP BIND requests.  **Note:** This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (`ldap_simple_bind`) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (`ldap_simple_bind_s`). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use `ldap_simple_bind` or `ldap_simple_bind_s` to communicate with a Domain Controller.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Negotiate signing`. Configuring this setting to `Require signing` also conforms to the benchmark.
      Rationale: Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients' is set to 'Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption'
      Description: This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed by clients for applications using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption`.  **Note:** These values are dependent on the _Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level_ (Rule 2.3.11.7) security setting value.
      Rationale: You can enable both options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other words, these options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether a computer can be shut down when a user is not logged on. If this policy setting is enabled, the shutdown command is available on the Windows logon screen. It is recommended to disable this policy setting to restrict the ability to shut down the computer to users with credentials on the system.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** In Server 2008 R2 and older versions, this setting had no impact on Remote Desktop (RDP) / Terminal Services sessions - it only affected the local console. However, Microsoft changed the behavior in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above, where if set to Enabled, RDP sessions are also allowed to shut down or restart the server.
      Rationale: Users who can access the console locally could shut down the computer. Attackers could also walk to the local console and restart the server, which would cause a temporary DoS condition. Attackers could also shut down the server and leave all of its applications and services unavailable. As noted in the Description above, the Denial of Service (DoS) risk of enabling this setting dramatically increases in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above, as even remote users could then shut down or restart the server from the logon screen of an RDP session.

      Description: This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems. The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32 tools, because only one of the files will be available.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity, failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.

Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources, such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be located and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: This setting determines the strength of the default DACL for objects.

      Description: This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:  - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. - If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.  Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

      Description: This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system. Secure locations are limited to the following:  - `…\Program Files\`, including subfolders - `…\Windows\System32\` - `…\Program Files (x86)\`, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)  **Note:** Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the state of this security setting.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with UIAccess rights has the following abilities:  - To set the foreground window. - To drive any application window using SendInput function. - To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput. - To set journal hooks. - To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

      Rationale: Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to disclose their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very distinct appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and the elevation prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who become accustomed to the secure desktop will recognize a spoofed elevation prompt dialog box and not fall for the trick.

      Description: This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Allow (default)`.
      Rationale: Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.

      Description: Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.  The recommended state for this setting is: `No`.  **Note:** When the `Apply local firewall rules` setting is configured to `No`, it's recommended to also configure the `Display a notification setting` to `No`. Otherwise, users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Audit IPsec Driver' is set to 'Success and Failure'
      Description: This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:  - 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. - 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. - 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. - 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Success and Failure`.

      Description: This setting configures the start type for the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) client driver service (`MRxSmb10`), which is recommended to be disabled.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Disable driver (recommended)`.  **Note:** Do not, _under any circumstances_, configure this overall setting as `Disabled`, as doing so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious problems.
      Rationale: Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.  More information on this can be found at the following links:  [Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/09/16/stop-using-smb1/)  [Disable SMB v1 in Managed Environments with Group Policy – "Stay Safe" Cyber Security Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/staysafe/2017/05/17/disable-smb-v1-in-managed-environments-with-ad-group-policy/)  [Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy – Microsoft Security Guidance blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2017/06/15/disabling-smbv1-through-group-policy/)

      Description: This setting controls LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS to help make it more secure.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended)`.  **Note:** All LDAP clients must have the [CVC-2017-8563](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8563) security update to be compatible with Domain Controllers that have this setting enabled.  **Note #2:** In March 2020, Microsoft added a new GPO setting named _Domain controller: LDAP server channel binding token requirements_ which was bundled with that month’s Windows security patches. This new “native” setting configures the exact same `LdapEnforceChannelBinding` registry value and does not depend on an ADMX template. Therefore it should be considered a “superseding” method of achieving the same results. However, since Extended Support ended on January 14, 2020 for Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2, and they are no longer receiving security patches (unless hosted on Azure or under a paid support contract), they typically do not have the March 2020 (or later) patch readily available. If this is the case in your environment, this ADMX-based setting should be used with those OSes instead of the new native setting.  More information on this setting is available at: [Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034879/how-to-add-the-ldapenforcechannelbinding-registry-entry)

The available methods are:  - The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts. - The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server (WINS). - The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if broadcast failed. - The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if the query failed.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: P-node (recommended)` (point-to-point).  **Note:** Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the `NodeType` registry value is present, it overrides any `DhcpNodeType` registry value. If neither `NodeType` nor `DhcpNodeType` is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server configured.
      Rationale: In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks, setting the node type to P-node (point-to-point) will prevent the system from sending out NetBIOS broadcasts.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'WDigest Authentication' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: When WDigest authentication is enabled, Lsass.exe retains a copy of the user's plaintext password in memory, where it can be at risk of theft. If this setting is not configured, WDigest authentication is disabled in Windows 8.1 and in Windows Server 2012 R2; it is enabled by default in earlier versions of Windows and Windows Server.  For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "[Mitigating Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036)" documents.  For more information about `UseLogonCredential`, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2871997: [Microsoft Security Advisory Update to improve credentials protection and management May 13, 2014](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2871997).  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Preventing the plaintext storage of credentials in memory may reduce opportunity for credential theft.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (AutoAdminLogon) Enable Automatic Logon (not recommended)' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This setting is separate from the Welcome screen feature in Windows XP and Windows Vista; if that feature is disabled, this setting is not disabled. If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks to which the computer is connected. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext, and the specific registry key that stores this value is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group.  For additional information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 324737: [How to turn on automatic logon in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/324737).  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks that the computer is connected to. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext. The specific registry key that stores this setting is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group. As a result, this entry is appropriate only if the computer is physically secured and if you ensure that untrusted users cannot remotely see the registry.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting IPv6) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)' is set to 'Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled'
      Description: IP source routing is a mechanism that allows the sender to determine the IP route that a datagram should follow through the network.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled`.
      Rationale: An attacker could use source routed packets to obscure their identity and location. Source routing allows a computer that sends a packet to specify the route that the packet takes.

      Description: IP source routing is a mechanism that allows the sender to determine the IP route that a datagram should take through the network. It is recommended to configure this setting to Not Defined for enterprise environments and to Highest Protection for high security environments to completely disable source routing.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled`.
      Rationale: An attacker could use source routed packets to obscure their identity and location. Source routing allows a computer that sends a packet to specify the route that the packet takes.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to override OSPF generated routes' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.  An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment.  The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

      Control-ID: 18.4.8
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode (recommended)' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: The DLL search order can be configured to search for DLLs that are requested by running processes in one of two ways:  - Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current working folder. - Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the system path.  When enabled, the registry value is set to 1. With a setting of 1, the system first searches the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current working folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first searches the current working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in the system path.  Applications will be forced to search for DLLs in the system path first. For applications that require unique versions of these DLLs that are included with the application, this entry could cause performance or stability problems.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** More information on how Safe DLL search mode works is available at this link: [Dynamic-Link Library Search Order - Windows applications | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)
      Rationale: If a user unknowingly executes hostile code that was packaged with additional files that include modified versions of system DLLs, the hostile code could load its own versions of those DLLs and potentially increase the type and degree of damage the code can render.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (ScreenSaverGracePeriod) The time in seconds before the screen saver grace period expires (0 recommended)' is set to 'Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds'
      Description: Windows includes a grace period between when the screen saver is launched and when the console is actually locked automatically when screen saver locking is enabled.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds`.
      Rationale: The default grace period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period configuration, your computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from someone who could approach the console and attempt to log on to the computer before the lock takes effect. An entry to the registry can be made to adjust the length of the grace period.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (WarningLevel) Percentage threshold for the security event log at which the system will generate a warning' is set to 'Enabled: 90% or less'
      Description: This setting can generate a security audit in the Security event log when the log reaches a user-defined threshold.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: 90% or less`.  **Note:** If log settings are configured to Overwrite events as needed or Overwrite events older than x days, this event will not be generated.
      Rationale: If the Security log reaches 90 percent of its capacity and the computer has not been configured to overwrite events as needed, more recent events will not be written to the log. If the log reaches its capacity and the computer has been configured to shut down when it can no longer record events to the Security log, the computer will shut down and will no longer be available to provide network services.

      Control-ID: 18.5.4.1
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Turn off multicast name resolution' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location of the requested system.  **Note:** To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to `Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP` (on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different NIC hardware installations.

      Description: You can use this procedure to controls user's ability to install and configure a Network Bridge.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: The Network Bridge setting, if enabled, allows users to create a Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) bridge, enabling them to connect two or more physical network segments together. A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to two different networks to share data between those networks.  In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic to only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk and attack surface from the bridged network.

      Description: Although this "legacy" setting traditionally applied to the use of Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) in Windows 2000, Windows XP & Server 2003, this setting now freshly applies to the Mobile Hotspot feature in Windows 10 & Server 2016.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Hardened UNC Paths' is set to 'Enabled, with "Require Mutual Authentication" and "Require Integrity" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares'
      Description: This policy setting configures secure access to UNC paths.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled, with "Require Mutual Authentication" and "Require Integrity" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares`.  **Note:** If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer systems, then the "`Privacy`" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption. However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths completely inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and thorough testing.
      Rationale: In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the [MS15-011](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-011) / [MSKB 3000483](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000483) security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (`NetworkProvider.admx/adml`) was also provided with the security update.  Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:  `\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1`  `\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1`  **Note:** A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.  Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: [Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askpfeplat/archive/2015/02/23/guidance-on-deployment-of-ms15-011-and-ms15-014.aspx).

      Description: This policy setting prevents computers from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to either the Internet or to a Windows domain.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: 1 = Minimize simultaneous connections`.
      Rationale: Preventing bridged network connections can help prevent a user unknowingly allowing traffic to route between internal and external networks, which risks exposure to sensitive internal data.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Include command line in process creation events' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines what information is logged in security audit events when a new process has been created.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** The feature that this setting controls is not normally supported in OSes older than Server 2012 R2. However, in February 2015 Microsoft added support for the feature to Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) via a special update - [KB3004375](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3004375/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-windows-command-line-aud). Therefore, this setting is also important to set on those older OSes in the event that the update is installed on them.
      Rationale: When this policy setting is enabled, any user who has read access to the security events can read the command-line arguments for any successfully created process. Command-line arguments may contain sensitive or private information such as passwords or user data.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Encryption Oracle Remediation' is set to 'Enabled: Force Updated Clients'
      Description: Some versions of the CredSSP protocol that is used by some applications (such as Remote Desktop Connection) are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client. This policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers and allows you to set the level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Force Updated Clients`.
      Rationale: This setting is important to mitigate the CredSSP encryption oracle vulnerability, for which information was published by Microsoft on 03/13/2018 in [CVE-2018-0886 | CredSSP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886). All versions of Windows Server from Server 2008 (non-R2) onwards are affected by this vulnerability, and will be compatible with this recommendation provided that they have been patched up through May 2018 (or later).

      Control-ID: 18.8.4.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two options to help protect against this risk.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: [Protect Remote Desktop credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard)
      Rationale: _Restricted Admin Mode_ was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could potentially be compromised. _Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard_ helps you protect your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be enabled and supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy' is set to 'Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical'
      Description: This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:  - `Good`: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with. - `Bad`: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not allow known bad drivers to be initialized. - `Bad, but required for boot`: The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver. - `Unknown`: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.  If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.  If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical`.
      Rationale: This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your system.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Configure registry policy processing: Do not apply during periodic background processing' is set to 'Enabled: FALSE'
      Description: The "Do not apply during periodic background processing" option prevents the system from updating affected policies in the background while the computer is in use. When background updates are disabled, policy changes will not take effect until the next user logon or system restart.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: FALSE` (unchecked).
      Rationale: Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain policy changes take effect more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system restart.

      Description: This policy prevents the user from showing account details (email address or user name) on the sign-in screen.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

      Description: This policy setting prevents connected users from being enumerated on domain-joined computers.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information using other methods.

      Description: This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a picture password.   The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** If the picture password feature is permitted, the user's domain password is cached in the system vault when using it.
      Rationale: Picture passwords bypass the requirement for a typed complex password. In a shared work environment, a simple shoulder surf where someone observed the on-screen gestures would allow that person to gain access to the system without the need to know the complex password. Vertical monitor screens with an image are much more visible at a distance than horizontal key strokes, increasing the likelihood of a successful observation of the mouse gestures.

      Description: This policy setting allows you to turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance on this computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must explicitly click the Yes button to allow the expert to remotely control the workstation.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow Microsoft accounts to be optional' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting lets you control whether Microsoft accounts are optional for Windows Store apps that require an account to sign in. This policy only affects Windows Store apps that support it.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts instead of using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store apps. This provides the organization with greater control over relevant credentials. Microsoft accounts cannot be centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security policies cannot be applied to them, which could put any information accessed by using Microsoft accounts at risk.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Set the default behavior for AutoRun' is set to 'Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands'
      Description: This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands are generally stored in `autorun.inf` files. They often launch the installation program or other routines.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands`.
      Rationale: Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Turn off Autoplay' is set to 'Enabled: All drives'
      Description: Autoplay starts to read from a drive as soon as you insert media in the drive, which causes the setup file for programs or audio media to start immediately. An attacker could use this feature to launch a program to damage the computer or data on the computer. Autoplay is disabled by default on some removable drive types, such as floppy disk and network drives, but not on CD-ROM drives.  **Note:** You cannot use this policy setting to enable Autoplay on computer drives in which it is disabled by default, such as floppy disk and network drives.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: All drives`.
      Rationale: An attacker could use this feature to launch a program to damage a client computer or data on the computer.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow Telemetry' is set to 'Enabled: 0 - Security [Enterprise Only]' or 'Enabled: 1 - Basic'
      Description: This policy setting determines the amount of diagnostic and usage data reported to Microsoft:  - A value of `0 - Security [Enterprise Only]` will send minimal data to Microsoft. This data includes Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) & Windows Defender data, if enabled, and telemetry client settings. Setting a value of 0 applies to enterprise, EDU, IoT and server devices only. Setting a value of 0 for other devices is equivalent to choosing a value of 1. - A value of `1 - Basic` sends only a basic amount of diagnostic and usage data. Note that setting values of 0 or 1 will degrade certain experiences on the device. - A value of `2 - Enhanced` sends enhanced diagnostic and usage data. - A value of `3 - Full` sends the same data as a value of 2, plus additional diagnostics data, including the files and content that may have caused the problem.  Windows 10 telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: 0 - Security [Enterprise Only]` or `Enabled: 1 - Basic`.  **Note:** If the _Allow Telemetry_ setting is configured to `0 - Security [Enterprise Only]`, then the options in Windows Update to defer upgrades and updates will have no effect.  **Note #2:** In the Microsoft Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates, the zero value was initially named `0 - Off [Enterprise Only]`, but it was renamed to `0 - Security [Enterprise Only]` starting with the Windows 10 Release 1511 Administrative Templates.
      Rationale: Sending any data to a 3rd party vendor is a security concern and should only be done on an as needed basis.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Toggle user control over Insider builds' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether users can access the Insider build controls in the Advanced Options for Windows Update. These controls are located under "Get Insider builds," and enable users to make their devices available for downloading and installing Windows preview software.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** This policy setting applies only to devices running Windows Server 2016, up until Release 1703. For Release 1709 or newer, Microsoft encourages using the `Manage preview builds` setting (Rule 18.9.102.1.1). We have kept this setting in the benchmark to ensure that any older builds of Windows Server 2016 in the environment are still enforced.
      Rationale: It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready builds.

      Control-ID: 18.9.30.4
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Turn off shell protocol protected mode' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting allows you to configure the amount of functionality that the shell protocol can have. When using the full functionality of this protocol, applications can open folders and launch files. The protected mode reduces the functionality of this protocol allowing applications to only open a limited set of folders. Applications are not able to open files with this protocol when it is in the protected mode. It is recommended to leave this protocol in the protected mode to increase the security of Windows.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Limiting the opening of files and folders to a limited set reduces the attack surface of the system.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting helps prevent Remote Desktop clients from saving passwords on a computer.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** If this policy setting was previously configured as Disabled or Not configured, any previously saved passwords will be deleted the first time a Remote Desktop client disconnects from any server.
      Rationale: An attacker with physical access to the computer may be able to break the protection guarding saved passwords. An attacker who compromises a user's account and connects to their computer could use saved passwords to gain access to additional hosts.

      Control-ID: 18.9.59.3.3.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow drive redirection' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree in Windows Explorer in the following format:  `\\TSClient\<driveletter>$`  If local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the data that is stored on them.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present on a compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local computer during the Remote Desktop session.

      Control-ID: 18.9.59.3.9.1
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Always prompt for password upon connection' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Require secure RPC communication' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting allows you to specify whether Remote Desktop Services requires secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication with all clients or allows unsecured communication.  You can use this policy setting to strengthen the security of RPC communication with clients by allowing only authenticated and encrypted requests.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Allowing unsecure RPC communication can exposes the server to man in the middle attacks and data disclosure attacks.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections' is set to 'Enabled: SSL'
      Description: This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to secure communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: SSL`.  **Note:** In spite of this setting being labelled _SSL_, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.
      Rationale: The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Set client connection encryption level' is set to 'Enabled: High Level'
      Description: This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you are using native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is not recommended. This policy does not apply to SSL encryption.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: High Level`.
      Rationale: If Remote Desktop client connections that use low level encryption are allowed, it is more likely that an attacker will be able to decrypt any captured Remote Desktop Services network traffic.

      Control-ID: 18.9.59.3.11.2
      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Do not use temporary folders per session' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: By default, Remote Desktop Services creates a separate temporary folder on the RD Session Host server for each active session that a user maintains on the RD Session Host server. The temporary folder is created on the RD Session Host server in a Temp folder under the user's profile folder and is named with the `sessionid`. This temporary folder is used to store individual temporary files.  To reclaim disk space, the temporary folder is deleted when the user logs off from a session.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Disabling this setting keeps the cached data independent for each session, both reducing the chance of problems from shared cached data between sessions, and keeping possibly sensitive data separate to each user session.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow indexing of encrypted files' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting controls whether encrypted items are allowed to be indexed. When this setting is changed, the index is rebuilt completely. Full volume encryption (such as BitLocker Drive Encryption or a non-Microsoft solution) must be used for the location of the index to maintain security for encrypted files.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Indexing and allowing users to search encrypted files could potentially reveal confidential data stored within the encrypted files.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Configure detection for potentially unwanted applications' is set to 'Enabled: Block'
      Description: This policy setting controls detection and action for Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA), which are sneaky unwanted application bundlers or their bundled applications, that can deliver adware or malware.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Block`.  For more information, see this link: [Block potentially unwanted applications with Windows Defender Antivirus | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-windows-defender-antivirus)
      Rationale: Potentially unwanted applications can increase the risk of your network being infected with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT resources in cleaning up the applications. They should be blocked from installation.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Allow user control over installs' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any control over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from a system, which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.  **Note:** This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.  **Caution:** If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational event log.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** In Microsoft's own hardening guidance, they recommend the opposite value, `Enabled`, because having this data logged improves investigations of PowerShell attack incidents. However, the default ACL on the PowerShell Operational log allows Interactive User (i.e. _any_ logged on user) to read it, and therefore possibly expose passwords or other sensitive information to unauthorized users. If Microsoft locks down the default ACL on that log in the future (e.g. to restrict it only to Administrators), then we will revisit this recommendation in a future release.
      Rationale: There are potential risks of capturing passwords in the PowerShell logs. This setting should only be needed for debugging purposes, and not in normal operation, it is important to ensure this is set to `Disabled`.

The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** If you enable and then disable this policy setting, any values that were previously configured for `RunAsPassword` will need to be reset.
      Rationale: Although the ability to store RunAs credentials is a convenient feature it increases the risk of account compromise slightly. For example, if you forget to lock your desktop before leaving it unattended for a few minutes another person could access not only the desktop of your computer but also any hosts you manage via WinRM with cached RunAs credentials.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting specifies whether computers in your environment will receive security updates from Windows Update or WSUS. If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site for updates that apply to them.  After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the service will work:  - 2 - Notify for download and auto install _(Notify before downloading any updates)_ - 3 - Auto download and notify for install _(Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)_ - 4 - Auto download and schedule the install _(Automatically download updates and install them on the schedule specified below.))_ - 5 - Allow local admin to choose setting _(Leave decision on above choices up to the local Administrators (Not Recommended))_  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.  **Note:** The sub-setting "_Configure automatic updating:_" has 4 possible values – all of them are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we suggest using a value of `4 - Auto download and schedule the install`. This suggestion is not a scored requirement.  **Note #2:** Organizations that utilize a 3rd-party solution for patching may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation, and instead configure it to `Disabled` so that the native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the 3rd-party patching process.
      Rationale: Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

It will have no impact if any other option is selected.
      Rationale: Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This policy setting specifies that Automatic Updates will wait for computers to be restarted by the users who are logged on to them to complete a scheduled installation.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** This setting applies only when you configure Automatic Updates to perform scheduled update installations. If you configure the Configure Automatic Updates setting to Disabled, this setting has no effect.
      Rationale: Some security updates require that the computer be restarted to complete an installation. If the computer cannot restart automatically, then the most recent update will not completely install and no new updates will download to the computer until it is restarted. Without the auto-restart functionality, users who are not security-conscious may choose to indefinitely delay the restart, therefore keeping the computer in a less secure state.

These controls enable users to make their devices available for downloading and installing preview (beta) builds of Windows software.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Disable preview builds`.
      Rationale: It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready builds.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days'
      Description: This policy setting determines the level of Preview Build or Feature Updates to receive, and when.  The Windows readiness level for each new Windows 10 Feature Update is classified in one of 5 categories, depending on your organizations level of comfort with receiving them:  - **Preview Build - Fast:** Devices set to this level will be the first to receive new builds of Windows with features not yet available to the general public. Select Fast to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft, and provide suggestions on new functionality.  - **Preview Build - Slow:** Devices set to this level receive new builds of Windows before they are available to the general public, but at a slower cadence than those set to Fast, and with changes and fixes identified in earlier builds.  - **Release Preview:** Receive builds of Windows just before Microsoft releases them to the general public.  - **Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted):** Receive feature updates when they are released to the general public.  - **Semi-Annual Channel:** Feature updates will arrive when they are declared Semi-Annual Channel. This usually occurs about 4 months after Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), indicating that Microsoft, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), partners and customer believe that the release is ready for broad deployment.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days`.  **Note:** If the "Allow Telemetry" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.  **Note #2:** Starting with Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called **Dual Scan**, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to `Not Configured` _or_ configure the setting _Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update_ (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links: - [Demystifying “Dual Scan” – WSUS Product Team Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsus/2017/05/05/demystifying-dual-scan/) - [Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsus/2017/08/04/improving-dual-scan-on-1607/)  **Note #3:** Prior to Windows Server 2016 R1709, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows Server 2016 R1709, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days.
      Rationale: Forcing new features without prior testing in your environment could cause software incompatibilities as well as introducing new bugs into the operating system. In an enterprise managed environment, it is generally preferred to delay Feature Updates until thorough testing and a deployment plan is in place. This recommendation delays the _automatic_ installation of new features as long as possible.

      Description: This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.  **Note:** The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as [Microsoft Sysinternals Streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams).
      Rationale: A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may be moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and executed by an unsuspecting user.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Do not suggest third-party content in Windows spotlight' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether Windows will suggest apps and content from third-party software publishers.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps as well as images from the internet.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their profile.' is set to 'Enabled'
      Description: This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default, users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.
      Rationale: If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should provide a managed location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead of the user sharing files directly from their own user profile.

      Title: (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to 'Disabled'
      Description: This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.  **Note:** This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.  **Caution:** If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.  The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.
      Rationale: Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.
